## Why FastAPI 
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Here are some reasons why FastAPI is a great choice for building web applications and APIs:
1. **High Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks available, thanks to its use of asynchronous programming and the Starlette framework. It can handle a large number of requests per second, making it suitable for high-performance applications.
2. **Easy to Use**: FastAPI is designed to be easy to use and learn. It has a simple and intuitive syntax that allows developers to quickly create APIs with minimal boilerplate code.
3. **Automatic Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and Redoc. This makes it easy for developers to explore and test the API endpoints.
4. **Type Hints and Validation**: FastAPI leverages Python's type hints to provide automatic request validation and serialization. This helps catch errors early and ensures that the data being processed is in the expected format.
5. **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI has a built-in dependency injection system that makes it easy to manage and reuse components such as database connections, authentication, and other services.
6. **Asynchronous Support**: FastAPI fully supports asynchronous programming, allowing developers to write non-blocking code that can handle multiple requests concurrently. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations such as database queries and external API calls.
7. **Extensibility**: FastAPI is highly extensible and can be easily integrated with other libraries and frameworks. It supports middleware, custom request/response handling, and third-party plugins.
8. **Community and Ecosystem**: FastAPI has a growing community and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that can be used to enhance its functionality. This includes support for databases, authentication, testing, and more.
9. **Production Ready**: FastAPI is designed to be production-ready out of the box. It includes features such as automatic HTTPS, CORS support, and security best practices.
10. **Great for Microservices**: FastAPI's lightweight nature and high performance make it an excellent choice for building microservices and serverless applications. Its modular design allows developers to create small, focused services that can be easily deployed and scaled.
